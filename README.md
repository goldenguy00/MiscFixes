# Log Mute

Mutes some logs that are constantly spammed but should be entirely ignored. By default, it mostly targets the harmless vanilla logs from EffectManager.

## Custom Keyword Matching

If you still want to slim down the log output even further, theres some magical regex options in the cfg that allows you to target specific logs.

Works with Risk of Options, so it's highly recommended to download that when using this feature.
