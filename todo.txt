Doesnt throw errors but it removed items from a destroyed object which results in OnInventoryChanged nre's from some mods

        RoR2.MinionOwnership+MinionGroup.SetMinionOwner (RoR2.MinionOwnership minion, UnityEngine.Networking.NetworkInstanceId ownerId) (at <f7443728c4d4442b8c2db9f6c21a6e92>:IL_0022)
        RoR2.MinionOwnership.OnDestroy () (at <f7443728c4d4442b8c2db9f6c21a6e92>:IL_0000)

need to investigate convar stuff, egsToggle breaks with current hook. commenting out for now.
