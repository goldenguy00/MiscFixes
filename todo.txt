unity explorer error in lobby. doesn't fuck everything up anymore but it still throws from update, which is annoying


this is driver's fault technically since he heavily abuses this debuff

        NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object

Doesnt throw errors but it removed items from a destroyed object which results in OnInventoryChanged nre's from some mods
